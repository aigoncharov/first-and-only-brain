Variance: $Var(X) = E(X - E(X))^{2} = E(X^{2}) - (E(X))^{2}$
Standard deviation: $SD(X) = \sqrt{Var(X)}$

### Properties
1. $Var(X + c) = Var(X)$ for any constant $c$
2. $Var(cX) = c^{2}Var(X)$
3. If X and Y are independent, then $Var(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y)$
4. The only R.V.s to have 0 variance are constants. For others, $Var(X) > 0$.
