#cognitive_science 

Schools of thought:
1. Rationalist. Innate knowledge -> new knowledge -> behavior.
2. Empiricist. Experiences -> behavior

Scientific thinking leverages:
1. Deduction. Given the rule and the cause, deduce the effect.
2. Induction. Given the cause and the effect, induce the rule.
3. Abduction. Given the effect and the rule, abduct the cause.

**Scientific model** - abstract representation of real-world systems to help us better understand them.

*Hypothesis -> model -> model evaluation -> asserting the result*.
