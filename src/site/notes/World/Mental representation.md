## Central hypothesis

Thinking can be best understood in terms of representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures.
The approach to understanding mind based on the hypothesis - Computational-Representational Understanding of Mind (CRUM).

**Cognitive theory** - set of representational structures and set of precesses.
**Computational model** - makes structures and processes more precise by finding an analogy with computer programs.

*Mind <-> Brain == Software <--> Hardware*
Contested by, "intelligence and intelligent behavior are the results of being immersed in society and culture".

## Schools of CRUM
1. [[World/Logic\|Logic]]
2. [[World/Rules and concepts\|Rules and concepts]]
4. [[World/Analogies\|Analogies]]
5. Images
6. Connections

## Tri-level hypothesis

We should study mind at 3 levels:
1. Computational level - task analysis, problem spec
3. Algorithmic level - data struct, i/o
4. Implementation level - physical realization

## Criteria for evaluating theories of mental representation

3. Psychological plausibility
4. Neurological plausibility
5. Practical applicability
	1. Education
	2. Design
	3. Intelligent systems
	4. Mental illness

## Components
1. Represented world (domain that representations are about)
2. Representing world (domain that contains representations)
3. Representing rules
4. Process
