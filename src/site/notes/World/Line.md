#calculus 

2 points *or* point and slope
Slope: $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \tan{\theta}$
Equation: 
$$m=\frac{y-y_1}{x-x_1}$$ 
$$m*(x-x_1)=y-y_1$$
$$y = mx + b$$
where m - slope, b - y-intercept

Parallel lines - slopes (m) are the same
Perpendicular lines - slopes are negative reciprocals ($m_1 = -\frac{1}{m_2}$)
