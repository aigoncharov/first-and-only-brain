#cognitive_science 

Domain knowledge - rules about the world. Explicit.
Control knowledge - strategies to solve the problem. Tacit (implicit).

Heuristic - type of control knowledge. Acts as a shortcut.

**Learning new rules**:
- Generalization
- Specialization
- Compilation
- Chunking

## Concepts

**Concept** - abstract representation, equivalent class of perceptions in the world.
Concepts allow as to index our actions.
Concepts sometimes could be described by rules. "IF x is a course, THEN x has an instructor".
Concepts can be summarized as a set of slots. Concept course = (A kind of: process),(Kinds of courses: lecture course, seminar, etc),(Instructor),(Room).

**Types of concepts**: 
1. Axiomatic. Formal set of conditions. Example: triangle.
2. Prototypical. By typical example with overridable properties. Example: chair.
3. Exemplar. Implicit abstractions of instances (examplars). Example: beauty.
4. Qualia. Raw sensations. Example: sour.

**Learning new concepts**:
- Generalization
- Specialization
- Compilation
- From experience

**Identifying concepts:**
- Matching - matching the slots of various relevant concepts against the particular information known about the new concept
- Inference - once the concept is matched people can make inferences about the situation
