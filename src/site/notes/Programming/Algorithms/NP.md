#algorithms 
NP - class of all search problems (verifiable in polynomial time)
P - subclass of search problems solvable in polynomial time
NP-complete - hardest in NP. If proven that any NP-complete problem can be solved in polynomial time, then all NP problems are solvable in polynomial time.
NP-hard - at least as hard as any NP problem, but not in NP itself.
