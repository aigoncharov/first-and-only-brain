## Central hypothesis

Thinking can be best understood in terms of representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures.
The approach to understanding mind based on the hyposesis - Computational-Representational Understanding of Mind (CRUM).

**Cognitive theory** - set of representational structures and set of precesses.
**Computational model** - makes structures and processes more precise by finding an analogy with computer programs.

*Mind <-> Brain == Software <--> Hardware*
Contested by, "intelligence and intelligent behavior are the results of being immersed insociety and culture".

## Tri-level hypothesis

We should study mind at 3 levels:
1. Computational level - task analysis, problem spec
3. Algorithmic level - data struct, i/o
4. Implementation level - physical relization

## Criteria for evaluating theories of mental representation

3. Psycological plausability
4. Neurological plausability
5. Practical applicability
	1. Education
	2. Design
	3. Intelligent systems
	4. Mental illness
