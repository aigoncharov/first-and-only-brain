#cognitive_science 

Syllogism - pattern of inference with two premises and a conclusion (All S are O. M is S. So, M is O). Form of deductive inference.

Propositional logic - simplest system of formal logic.
"If Paula is in library, then Quincy is in libraray" becomes "$p \to q$". "Paula is in library" is treated as indivisible whole.

Predicate logic - has difference between predicates and constants.
"Paula is in library" = "$L(p)$", where L - "is in library", "p" - Paula.
Alternate notation, "is-in-library(Paula)".
"All students are overworked" = "$(for-all\:x) (student(x) \to overworked(x))$"

## Relation to psycology

Positions in relation to logic:
1. Formal logic is important part of human reasoning.
2. Formal logic is only distantly realted to human reasoning, but it provides mathematical analysis of "optimal" reasoning.
3. Formal logic is only distantly realted to human reasoning, so cognitive science should pursue other approaches.
