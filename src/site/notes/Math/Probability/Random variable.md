#probability 

**Random variable** - function mapping the sample space ([[Math/Probability/Definition of probability\|Definition of probability]]) to the real numbers.

## Function of a random variable

Given r.v. X, sample space S, function $g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$,  $g(X)$ is the r.v. that maps s to g(X(s)) for all $s \in S$

## Independence of 2 r.v.s

R.V.s X and Y are independent if
$$P(X \leq x, Y \leq y) = P(X \leq x)P(y \leq y)$$
for all $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$

**In the discrete case** this is equivalent to 
$$P(X = x, Y = y) = P(X = x)P(Y = y)$$

for all x,y in the support of X and Y correspondingly.
